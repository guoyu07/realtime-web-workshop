# Exercise 0 - Development Environments

## Dev skills

It's expected that you have basic JavaScript and a backend technology knowledge (e.g. PHP, Ruby, node.js, C# .NET, Python).

## Dev environment

### Local

1. A text editor
2. A web server - PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET, node.js *Note: Workshop uses PHP so if you choose to use your own backend tech there may be a bit of extra work required*
3. A web browser with developer tools
4. Exercise files from: https://github.com/pusher/realtime-web-workshop

   Via git using: `git clone git@github.com:pusher/realtime-web-workshop.git`

   Or zip file by downloading: <https://github.com/pusher/realtime-web-workshop/zipball/master>
   
   This repo contains the files required for each exercise. It contains a `start` folder with files that let you start from a point where the previous exercise has been completed. It also contains a `sln` folder with a proposed solution (then used as the `start` for the next exercise).
   
   After exercise 1 you may not want to use these files and simply continue to develop your existing application.
